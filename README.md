This project served as my bachelor's degree graduation work. The primary aim of the project was to:
•	Increase the capacity of driving schools: By providing an efficient and scalable training solution.
•	Simulate diverse environments: The simulator allows any driving environment to be created and reproduced consistently, offering standardized training experiences.
•	Develop pre-driving skills: Trainees can practice essential driving skills repeatedly and effectively, which is often difficult to achieve in a real car.
•	Provide stress-free training: The simulator offers a safe and controlled environment where students can learn without the pressure and stress that might hinder skill development.
•	Build self-confidence: After completing the simulator training phase, trainees transition to driving in a learner car with greater confidence, as they have already mastered the fundamental driving skills.
